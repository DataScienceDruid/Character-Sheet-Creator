Module 3 - Open Ended Project

Current Ideas:
* R creating linear regression models based on data entered in C++ script
* Python game of some sort that has C++ for logic or perhaps something else I dunno
* Website of some kind?
* R Shiny app that interacts with C++ somehow

Main: Validates user input and stores things to appropriate file
Character Sheet Creator??
User answers questions and answers promptes for name, class, etc.
then Python performs the RNG and displays a Character sheet image
Can use `from PIL import Image, ImageDraw` to create, load, and draw on images
maybe have some existing pixel art for the characters class.
